		Changed shadow project names to both descriptive (contains original project name) and attentive (contains DO_NOT_DELETE).

		ActiveFileChanged observer patterns are now deprecated. Instead have written CursorChanged pattern, which supersedes the former. Feature added for better speculation calculation
