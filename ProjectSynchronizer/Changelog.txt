1.0.1: 	Improvement of active file changed signaling when the input of an editor has changed.
1.0.2:	Wrote missing Javadoc.
1.0.3:	Added support for last modification dates for project (using TaskWorker#addTask as base).
1.0.5:	Added support for internal synchronization check.
		Changed shadow project names to both descriptive (contains original project name) and attentive (contains DO_NOT_DELETE).
1.0.6:	Fixed a bug in shadow project check (due to updates in shadow project naming).
1.0.7:	No more synchronizing .class files.
1.0.8:	Fixed a NPE in skipped file test (for synchronization).

1.2.0:	Implemented hiding for shadow projects using a java element filter.

1.5.1:	Using ISelectionListener (SynchronizerCursorListener.java) as a post selection listener instead of the old IPartListener (SynchronizerPartListener.java). SynchronizerPartListener
		ActiveFileChanged observer patterns are now deprecated. Instead have written CursorChanged pattern, which supersedes the former. Feature added for better speculation calculation
		optimization priority. (issue 26)

1.5.3:	Added support for cleaning up the shadow projects (i.e., deleting the shadow projects that are not used anymore) at the beginning of the load phase. (issue 23)
1.5.4:	Added support for organizing the shadow projects into QFS Working Set at the beginning of the load phase. (issue 24, 25)
1.5.5:	Integration with the new zip library API. (issue 33, 34)
1.5.6:	Improvements so that multiple .zip files (in case log directory is big) can be send by e-mail. (issue 34)
1.5.7:	Changed the welcome message so that it contains live hyperlinks. 
1.5.8:	Minor point update for the release.
1.5.9:	Snapshots now exclude any .hg directory under the project folder.
