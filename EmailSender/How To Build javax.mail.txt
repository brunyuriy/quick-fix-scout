Since javax.mail must be created as a plug-in from the scratch using the mail.jar (there is no source), that project must be created in each computer using the following steps:
- File/New/Project
- Choose Plug-in from existing JAR archives
- Select mail.jar
- Name the project name and plug-in id as javax.mail (this is important since it is referred as this).
