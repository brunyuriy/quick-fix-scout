0.6.0: 	Initial release.
0.7.0: 	Implemented parser for that reads the usage logs.
0.7.1:	Implemented preference page for observer plug-in.
		Implemented activation/deactivation and let the user to select this.
0.7.2:	Changed plug-in identifier from 'usage' to 'observation' to be more consistent with speculation plug-in.
0.7.3:	Minor bug fix that was causing some of the proposals selected in the quick fix not to be recorded. 
		The reason was I was comparing the string equality of a change.getName() and correctionProposal.getDescription(). Now I do this and also compare the changes whenever possible.
0.7.4:	Minor performance bug fix: When the plug-in was deactivated, the ObserverGrabber was still creating a ObservationCompilationErrorLogger though there is no need for it (and it cannot work).
0.8.0:	Implementation of easy e-mail. Two options for sending email is added. 
		The user can either choose to send e-mailing the logs periodically (every-time Eclipse is opened) or send it going through the preference page and clicking on the button.
0.8.1:	Implementation for showing the user the paths for the most recent logs in Observer Preference Page.
0.8.2:	Added version number to the preference page.

0.9.2:	Added automated version checking at the beginning when plug-in loads.
1.0.0:	Added internal check before logging number of compilation errors (when user clicks on quick fix).
		If the synchronizer finds inconsistency between projects, current quick fix session is violated, and not logged.
1.0.1:	Added an error popup dialog when the logs cannot be sent due to zip file being too big.
1.0.2:	Added logging information for 'Observation' communications.

1.0.4:	Updated the log sending algorithm so that it won't try to send logs if the zip file is not created.

1.0.7:	Now using Timer library instead of TimeUtility.
1.0.8:	Updated the observer internal patterns with the new notification pattern: CursorChange observer pattern. (issue 26)
1.0.9:	Integration with the new zip library API. (issue 33, 34)
